# Welcome to Faiza's GitHub! 🌟

## About Me 👋
I'm Faiza, a passionate learner diving deep into the world of Data Analysis and Data Science. With a strong foundation in Python, OOP, web scraping, and data manipulation, I'm on a journey to become a skilled Data Scientist. These days, I'm particularly excited about web scraping with tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, and exploring Python libraries.

## Current Focus
- Building projects that showcase my learning.
- Learn more about data visualization and exploring data analysis methods.
- Connecting with the coding community and sharing my learning journey.

I'm new to GitHub and would appreciate any guidance or assistance as I navigate this platform!🙂
